## Objective

To analyze stock market data and build predictive models by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and applying ML algorithms using a dataset containing historical stock price information.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  

---

## Key Analysis Performed

- Time-based data inspection and null value handling  
- Visualization of historical trends and moving averages  
- Correlation heatmaps between features  
- Predictive modeling using regression algorithms  
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²  
- Comparison of actual vs predicted prices  

---

## Insights

- Stock prices exhibit patterns that can be partially modeled using supervised learning.  
- Moving averages and past prices show strong predictive power.  
- Model performance varies significantly based on feature selection and time window.  
- Visualizations helped in identifying volatility zones and seasonal trends.
