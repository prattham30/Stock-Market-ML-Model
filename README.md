Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze and predict stock market trends using historical stock data. The goal is to leverage data-driven techniques to understand stock behavior and explore the feasibility of forecasting prices.

Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and train ML models to predict stock prices using a dataset that contains time series stock market information.

Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Time Series Analysis & Modeling

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
Data cleaning and handling of missing values

Visual exploration of historical stock trends

Correlation analysis between features

Training and evaluation of regression-based ML models

Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices

📌 Insights
Stock prices show seasonality and noise; smoothing techniques may improve predictions.

Linear models work moderately well but may struggle with volatility.

Features like volume, moving average, and previous close impact predictions.

Visual trends help identify turning points and anomalies in price behavior.

💼 Business Impact
The model and insights can help:

Investors understand historical behavior before decision-making

Financial analysts assess model-based forecast reliability

Tech teams improve feature engineering for trading platforms

Identify patterns in stock movement that assist in strategy development
